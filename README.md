# Determine custom alphabet

The problem is as follows. 
You've been given the input (attached), comprised of a sequence of words 
that are arranged in alphabetical order (for some arbitrary alternate alphabet). 
Given this file, we would like you to return an ordered sequence of the letters 
that comprise the alphabet used to sort this list of terms. 
For instance, the output might look like this: 
```
Letter 1 => 'b'  Letter 2 => 'd'  Letter 3 => ...
```
Remember that the file given is just an example of a list of words and an alphabet. 
Your algorithm should not be tailored specifically to deal just with this file, 
but should work for all files like it.
